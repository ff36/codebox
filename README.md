Helping Codebox
----------------

#### Found a bug

If you found a repeatable bug then be sure to [search existing issues](https://github.com/ff63/codebox/issues) first.
Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and
Codebox version number.


#### New suggestion, but don't know how to program

For feature requests please first check our issues to
see if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll
move it to the feature backlog for you.


#### Help with the code

Awesome! _There are lots of ways you can help._ First read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ff36/codebox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Codebox is built in Java, it can currently run on any OS that has Java 8 installed. However, to
run Halo as a desktop application you might want to consider exporting a native package.
